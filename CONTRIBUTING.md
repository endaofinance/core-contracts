### New contributor guide

A good place to start to look for contributions is the project's issues page. There you can find issues with a "good first issue" tag which are good things to start working on.

### Making contributions

In general we use the standard Github contribution workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make changes on your fork
3. Submit a pull request to the upstream master branch
