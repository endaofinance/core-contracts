# Endao Core Contracts

These are the core contracts that impliment the Endao protocol.

## What is EnDAO?

EnDAO is a decentralized finance protocol designed to fund projects or people while minimizing the risk for funders. This is done through the "DeFi" ecosystem and is modeled after traditional finance endowments.

Funders invest capital into vault contracts. The capital is then invested in the DeFi ecosystem to generate income. The project requesting the funding receives its funding through the income generated.
